*generateTOC.pl* - generates table of content (TOC) in HTML files by parsing all header tags in it and inserting generated TOC inside of <content></content> tags of the original file.  
The TOC is composed with hyperlinks by pressing which you will jump to required location in the document.
Everything in between <exclude></exclude> tags are ignored.

*generateTOC.js* - same as generateTOC.pl but builds TOC on the fly once you load the HTML file in the browser.

*gitstat.sh* - gathers the statistics about most changed files (java, xml, js) in git repository. The results are stored in files_*.txt files and includes the file name and number of times it was changed.

*Notifier99.java* - shows particular message every 20 minutes.

*mysql-ping.java* - pings MySQL server indefinitely and prints the response time.

*md-to-html.java* - converts Markdown to HTML.
